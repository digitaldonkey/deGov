Feature: deGov - Content creation

  Background:
    Given I proof that the following Drupal modules are installed:
      | degov_node_press      |

  Scenario: I create a press entity and check that the header section is being displayed as expected
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "administrator" role
    And I am on "/node/add/press"
    And I fill in "Titel" with "Test1234"
    And I fill in Textarea with "Test1234"
    And I fill in "edit-field-press-date-0-value-date" with "01012018"
    And I scroll to bottom
    And I press button with label "Save" via translated text
    Then I should see HTML content matching "01.01.2018" after a while
    And I should see "Test1234" in the ".press__header-paragraphs h2" element
    And I should see "Test1234" in the ".press__header-paragraphs .press__teaser-text" element

  Scenario: I can select a view mode for views reference paragraphs
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "administrator" role
    And I am installing the "degov_paragraph_view_reference" module
    And I am on "/node/add/normal_page"
    And I choose "Content" via translation from tab menu
    And I press the "edit-field-content-paragraphs-add-more-add-modal-form-area-add-more" button
    And I wait 2 seconds
    And I click by CSS id "field-content-paragraphs-view-reference-add-more"
    Then I should see text matching "Ansichtsreferenz" via translation after a while
    And I should see 1 ".viewreference_target_id" element
    And I set the value of element ".viewreference_target_id" to "latest_events" via JavaScript
    And wait 2 seconds
    And I should see 1 ".viewsreference_view_mode:visible" elements via jQuery
