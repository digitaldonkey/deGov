# Robo scripts

Robo is a taskrunner, made in PHP. We are using it e.g. for running deGov updates easily. Learn more [about Robo](https://robo.li/getting-started/).

## Running in verbose mode

The verbose mode shows you, what happens in detail. E.g. Composer output. Otherwise the output it kept minimal.

```
composer degov-update -- -vvv
```
